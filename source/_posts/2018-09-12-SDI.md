title: Seismic Daylight Imaging (SDI) -- detect the fine-scale lithospheric structures
---

Advantage of SDI
---
1. The vertical resolution of the approach can achieve **as high as 2 km** for the lithosphere mantle structures.
2. 

Principle of SDI
---
The idea was first proposed by exploration geophysist Claerbout (1968). 

Developments of SDI
---
Rickett and Claerbout (1999) named the method to be Acoustic Daylight Imaging (ADI), then Schuster et al. (2004) used the term of Daylight Seismic Imaging. The most applications of the idea are in the field of exploration seismology.

Gorbatove et al. (2013) applied Claerbout's idea in seismology to detect the Moho across Australia. Kennett (2015) further extened the approach to investigating the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. These researches use the ambient noise, which give low imaging efficient. Sun and Kennett (2016) alternatively employed teleseismic events to image the lithospheric discontinuities.
